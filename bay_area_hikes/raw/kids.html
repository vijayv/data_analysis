        Rancho San Antonio County Park/Open Space Preserve</a><br>
        Rancho San Antonio's Deer Hollow Farm is one of the bay area's most popular 
        family destinations. Visit on a summer weekend and be prepared for the 
        crowds. For a quieter experience, go between Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
        The 10-acre working farm and educational center boasts an assortment of 
        animals and an amazing garden. Programs for school groups and other organizations 
        are available during the week. You must trek into the farm, a flat walk 
        of about a mile from the Rancho San Antonio parking lot (groups can use 
        a closer parking lot with prior permission). The park and open space preserve 
        boast picnic grounds and restrooms.<br>

        A non-profit organization runs this organic farm and wilderness preserve. 
        You'll find trails ranging from flat and easy to winding and tough, picnic 
        tables, farm animals, a short nature path, and restrooms. <br>

        Coyote Point Museum and Recreation Area</a><br>
        Hiking is limited here by the small size of the recreation area and its 
        proximity to urban sprawl. But Coyote Point makes a great day destination 
        for families with young children. First visit the museum, where educational 
        exhibits instruct on the bay area's environmental and nature issues. In 
        the wildlife habitat area, you may see bobcat, grey fox, badger, and a 
        host of birds. Afterwards, you can walk or drive to the recreation area's 
        clusters of picnic tables, or sit on the beach and watch the windsurfers. 
        Restrooms on site.<br>

        Kids may enjoy catching a glimpse of the resident peacock. Restrooms on 
        site. Bay Area Hiker's featured hike will probably be too tough for young 
        kids, instead shorten the hike with an out-and-back trek on Zinfandel 
        Trail. A few pear, plum, and walnut trees still bear fruit in an old orchard.<br>

        The preserve offers a nature center and easy hiking around Alpine Pond, 
        where children can look for crayfish, ducks, dragonflies, and birds. The 
        level 0.4 mile semi-loop hike takes place on an all-access trail, appropriate 
        for strollers.<br>

        The 0.75 mile all-access Chickadee Trail allows parents with children 
        in strollers to hike through a magnificent display of bay area plants, 
        including redwoods, chaparral, and oak. This trail is particularly enticing 
        in late winter and early spring, when water gushes down a gorge visible 
        from the trail.<br>

        upper peninsula, but Junipero Serra is also squeezed on all sides by residential 
        neighborhoods and Highway 280. The Live Oak Nature Trail is worth a visit.

      Tips for hiking with babies<br>
      </font>&#149; Make a list and check it each time before you head out.<br>
      &#149; Don't forget sun protection for babies under 6 months, like a floppy 
      hat, or a light blanket.<br>
      &#149; Keep babies warm. Bring an extra blanket, as well as a jacket and

      Tips for hiking with kids</font><br>
  <font size="-1">(with thanks to Dorothy Greco, mother of three)</font><br>
      &#149; Be sure to educate about <a href="plantpages/troubleplants.html">trail 
      hazards</a> (hydration, poison oak, rattlesnakes) before hitting the trails. 
      <br>
      &#149; A trip to the Lindsay Wildlife Museum in Walnut Creek (<a href="http://www.wildlife-museum.org/" target="_blank">http://www.wildlife-museum.org/</a>) 
      or the Coyote Point Museum in Burlingame (<a href="http://www.coyoteptmuseum.org/">http://www.coyoteptmuseum.org/</a>) 
      may be good introductions to bay area wildlife.<br>
      &#149; Apply sunscreen, and supply a hat.<br>
      &#149; Be sure to pack snacks and plenty of liquids. Avoid caffinated beverages. 
      Salty treats will replenish liquids lost to sweat better than sweet things.<br>
      &#149; Honor their limits. Rest when they need to. Turn back before you 
      planned if necessary. Pushing a child beyond his/her physical limit will 
      not be fun for anyone. <br>
      &#149; Before you go, show them photos of plants and animals they might 
      see along the way. Help them &quot;see&quot; acorns, leaves, flowers, and 
      animal prints. Some kids might enjoy bringing a small pad of paper and pencils 
      so they can draw what they see.<br>
      &#149; Many children will be motivated by a special something at the end 
      of the hike; a waterfall, unusual rock formation, or pretty picnic spot.<br>
      &#149; Be alert to trail traffic. If possible, choose hiking-only trails 
      to avoid conflicts with cyclists and equestrians. If you hike a multi-access 
      trail, be sure your children are aquainted with trail etiquette.<br>
      &#149; Before your trip, choose a strategy for bathroom needs. Bring soap 
      and a towel to clean up. <br>

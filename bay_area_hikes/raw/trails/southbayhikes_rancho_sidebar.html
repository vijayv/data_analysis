5.5 mile loop past Deer Hollow Farm and through grassland and chaparral.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>5.5 mile loop hike</b> is easy, with about 800 feet in elevation 
change. Trailhead elevation is around 350 feet. The hike is flat for about 
1 mile, climbs on a moderate grade to about 1045 feet, descends to about 
330 feet, and returns to the trailhead on a level grade. This is a good 
hike for beginners starting to stretch their legs a bit; experienced hikers 
will probably find it easy. There are opportunities at Rancho for longer, 
harder hikes.<br>

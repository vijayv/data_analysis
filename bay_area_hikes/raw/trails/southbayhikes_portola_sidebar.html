From Interstate 280 in San Mateo County, exit #25 Woodside Road/CA 84. Drive 
west about 6 miles to the junction with CA 35 (Skyline Boulevard). Turn 
left and drive south about 7 miles to the junction with Alpine Road. Turn 
right and drive west about 3 tortuous and winding miles on this narrow road 
(be especially careful for bicycle and motorcycle traffic on weekends). 
Turn left onto Portola State Park Road, and drive on the tiny and unpredictable 
road the remaining 3 miles to the entrance kiosk. Continue another 0.4 mile 
to the parking areas near the ranger station. If possible park in the Madrone 
lot (to the left just before the ranger station), or in the spots past the 
ranger station and across the bridge, on the right side of the road. (NOTE: 
do not be confused or tempted by the Alpine Road exit on 280. That section 
of Alpine Road deadends east of Skyline Boulevard.)<br>

Once you pass the green barn on the left, park in the following lot, on the left.)<br>
From Interstate 680 in Alameda County, exit Calaveras (exit 21a). Follow 
the brown &quot;parks&quot; signs. (If you've exited southbound, stay 
in the left lane of the exit ramp, turn left, drive under the freeway 
and then stay in the left lane through a stop sign, to remain on Calaveras.) 
Drive south on Calaveras about 4 miles to the junction with Geary, and 
turn left. Continue on Geary almost 2 miles to the park entrance kiosk, 
then continue past the visitor center to an unmarked dirt lot on the left.<br>

<br>
<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Gas, restaurants, and stores in nearby Pleasanton and Fremont. There are individual and group (hike-in) campsites. <br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Lots of parking inside the park in a few lots. Entrance fee (they call 
it a parking fee, but as you can't park on the road on the way into the 
park, I consider it an entrance fee) of $5 charged when kiosk is staffed. 
$2 dog fee. Maps available at the entrance kiosk, Visitor Center, or Interpretive 
Center. Note that if you plan on parking on Welch Creek Road, you must 
have a permit from EBRPD. Pit toilets at the edge of the parking lot. 
Drinking water near the Interpretive Center. There is no direct public 
transportation to the park. There is one designated handicapped parking 
space in this parking area, but Sunol's trails are not well-suited to 
wheelchairs.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Most trails are multi-use. A few are open to equestrians and hikers only, 
and a handful are hiking only. Dogs are permitted. Park is open from 7 
a.m. to dusk (the parking lot is locked at night, so be prompt returning 
to the trailhead).<br>

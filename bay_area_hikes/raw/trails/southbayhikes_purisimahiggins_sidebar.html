<i><font size="-1">In 
brief</font></i><font size="-1">:<br>
7 mile loop captures the best of this preserve -- redwoods, creek, chaparral, 
and great views.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>7 mile loop hike</b> is moderate, due to the elevation changes. 
You can create shorter out-and-back hikes that are easier. Trailhead elevation 
is around 400 feet, and the highest (trail) elevation in the park is just 
over 2000 feet. The featured hike climbs to about 1510 feet, then drops 
sharply back to the trailhead on steep Harkins Ridge Trail -- total elevation 
change is about 1400 feet. Unless you really like ascending steep grades, take the hike 
in the described direction. <br>
<br>
<i>Exposure</i>:<br>
Mostly shaded, with some sunny stretches.<br>
<br>
<i>Trail traffic</i>:<br>
Moderate. <br>
<br>
<i>Trail surfaces</i>:<br>
Dirt trails and fire roads.<br>
<br>
<i>Hiking time</i>:<br>
3 1/2 hours.<br>
<br>
<i>Season</i>:<br>
Nice any time; very pretty in autumn.<br>

<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
No entrance or parking fees. Lots of parking in 2 lots, and more street 
parking nearby. There are designated handicapped parking spots, and wheelchair-accessible 
portable toilets. Trails are unobstructed, and while not technically all-access 
(there are no bumpers), the main trail is wheelchair and stroller friendly. 
Drinking water and maps near the information signboard. Keep in mind that 
the shoreline and Bay Trail are part of an urban landscape. Although Point 
Isabel is very popular and often teaming with visitors, the Bay Trail is 
a bit lonely during off-hours. You may not want to walk alone here. AC Transit 
bus #43 services the park: visit the <a href="http://www.511.org" target="_blank">Transit 
Info website</a> for more details.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
No bicycles on the main trail at Point Isabel, but bikes are permitted on 
the adjacent Bay Trail. Horses are permitted, but exceptionally unlikely. 
Dogs are welcome, off leash at Point Isabel, and on leash on the Bay Trail. 
The park is open from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. <br>

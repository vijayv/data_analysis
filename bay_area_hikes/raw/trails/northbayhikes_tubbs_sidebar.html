From US 101 in Marin County, exit CA 37. Drive about 7.5 miles east on CA 
37, to the junction with 121. Continue east on CA 37 about 0.7 mile more, 
then turn right into the preserve (there is no refuge sign, but the entrance 
is just after a flurry of &quot;no parking&quot; signs along the side of 
the road). Note: there is no access to the refuge from westbound CA 37. 
If you're approaching that direction, you'll need to turn around at the 
CA 121 junction and enter from the eastbound lane of CA 37.<br>

<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Park is open from 8 a.m. to sunset. Trails are open to hikers only. No dogs. 
No food is permitted in the wildlife protection area (a good excuse for 
an after-hike lunch of green chili soup at Duarte's in Pescadero). Although 
you can take a short loop through the reserve's main unit year round, if 
you want to hike through the wildlife protection area you can do so by permit 
(available the same day at the reserve) from April to November. From December

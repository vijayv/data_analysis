map from MMWD</a> (pdf)<br>
&#149; <i>A Rambler's Guide to the Trails of Mt. Tamalpais and the Marin 
Headlands</i>, published by the Olmsted &amp; Bros. Map Co., is probably 
the best map for this section of Tam (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0941969061/bayareahiker-20" target="_blank">order 
this map from Amazon.com</a>). For small, obscure trails, use it in conjunction 
with<i> Tamalpais Trails</i>.<br>
&#149; <i>Trails of Northeast Marin County</i> is comparable to the Olmsted 
Map (available from <a href="http://www.peasepress.com" target="_blank">Pease 
Press</a>).<br>
&#149; <i>Mount Tam Trail Map</i>, published by Tom Harrison Maps (<a href="http://www.tomharrisonmaps.com" target="_blank">order 
from Tom Harrison Maps</a>). Comparable to the Olmsted map. <br>

this book from Amazon.com</a>), has an excellent map (unfortunately without 
topography), and detailed descriptions of all Tam trails.<br>
&#149; <i>Hiking Marin</i>, by Don and Kay Martin, has some terrific, but 
small maps (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961704497/bayareahiker-20" target="_blank">order

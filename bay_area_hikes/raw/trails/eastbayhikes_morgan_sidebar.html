4.7 mile loop at a remote oak and grassland preserve.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>4.7 mile</b> <b>loop hike</b> is pretty easy, with the exception 
of steep Coyote Trail. Elevation at the trailhead is around 2040 feet. The 
lowest elevation in the park is around 1100 feet, and highest elevation 
is around 2300 feet. Total elevation change for this hike is about 1000 
feet. There is somewhat significant elevation change in the park. Short 
hikes under 5 miles should present no problems for hikers in moderate condition. 
Longer hikes can be planned with minimal elevation change, but keep in mind 
that hiking at Morgan Territory is much more difficult in hot weather. <br>

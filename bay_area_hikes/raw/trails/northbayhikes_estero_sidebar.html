8.5 mile out and back hike along the rim of Drakes Estero.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>8.5 mile out and back hike</b> is moderate. 
Trailhead elevation is about 140 feet. The featured hike descends easily 
for about 1 mile, then climbs at a moderate-steep grade, descends, climbs, 
descends (continuing at the same moderate-steep grade), plateaus at about 
170 feet, then gently drops to sea level before backtracking to the trailhead. 
Total elevation change is about 600 feet. If the trails are muddy, it can 
be difficult to navigate the hills, and if it's windy and cold, you'll fight 
the wind for purchase.<br>

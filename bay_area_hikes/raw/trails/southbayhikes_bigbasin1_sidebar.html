There are quite a few routes that lead to Big Basin from the bay area. You 
can make the trip long and scenic or longer and more scenic. Check a road 
map to pick the routes suitable from your location. The following are somewhat 
generic directions. From CA 35 (Skyline Boulevard) in Santa Cruz County, 
turn west onto CA 9 at Saratoga Gap. Drive west about 6 miles and at a stop sign continue straight 
onto CA 236. Drive about 8 miles to the park headquarters, and park in the 
lot across the street from the ranger station/park headquarters. (Note: 
if you or your fellow passengers are prone to car sickness, the southern 
leg of 236 is less barfy. Instead of turning onto CA 236 6 miles west of 
Saratoga Gap, continue on CA 9 another 7 miles to Boulder Creek, and take 
a right onto CA 236 there.)<br>

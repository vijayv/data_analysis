<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Gas, pay phones, stores, and restaurants back in downtown Fairfax. No camping 
in the immediate area.<br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Very limited side of street parking in a residential neighborhood. The last 
stretch of road before the dead end is signed &quot;no parking on pavement,&quot; 
so make sure to find a spot well off the roadway, and respect any and all 
private parking spots. No entrance or parking fees, drinking water, paper 
maps, or toilet facilities. There are no designated handicapped parking 
spots, and trails are very poorly suited to wheelchairs and/or strollers. 
There is no public transit to the preserve, although Golden Gate Transit 
runs buses run along Sir Francis Drake, and it's a reasonable, mostly level 
bike ride to the trailhead. Visit <a href="http://www.511.org" target="_blank">511.org</a>  for more info.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Most preserve trails are multi-use, but a few exclude bicycles. Dogs are 
allowed in the preserve, on leash only. <br>

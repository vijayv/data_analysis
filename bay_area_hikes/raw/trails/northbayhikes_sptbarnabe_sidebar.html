<br>
<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Gas, pay phones, restaurants, and stores about 5 miles northwest, in Point 
Reyes Station, or about 10 miles southeast, in Fairfax. Several restaurants 
and stores can be reached by driving a few miles in either direction on 
Sir Francis Drake (Lagunitas to the southeast or Olema to the northwest). 
I recommend Two Bird Cafe on San Geronimo Valley Drive in San Geronimo (visible 
from Sir Francis Drake). The park has good individual campsites. <br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Lots of parking inside the park; room for about 8 vehicles just before the 
park entrance on the left side of Sir Francis Drake. Pay $8 entrance/parking 
fee at entrance kiosk (self-register if unattended). Additional fees for 
camping in the park. If the ranger station is open, you can pick up a map 
there. Restrooms and drinking water available throughout the developed area 
of the park. There are at least two designated handicapped parking spots 
in the park, and while the trails are not technically all-access paths, 
wheelchair users should be able to navigate more than a mile of Cross Marin 
Trail and Riding and Hiking Trail, the first stretch of this hike. <a href="http://www.marintransit.org" target="_blank">West 
Marin Stagecoach</a> offers public transportation to this trailhead.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
About half the trails are multi-use. A few are designated hiking only. Dogs 
are only permitted in the developed parts of the park (campground and picnic 
areas) as well as on paved park roads and the dirt "bike path" from the 
Redwood grove picnic area east to Shafter bridge, and always must be on 
leash. Park hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.<br>

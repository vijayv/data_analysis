<i><font size="-1">In 
brief</font></i><font size="-1">:<br>
12 mile out and back from the ocean to Berry Creek Falls. Mostly on fire 
roads, this is an easier hike than the equivalent journey from park headquarters, 
and far less crowded.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
The elevation at Big Basin ranges from about 15 feet to over 2280 feet. 
The featured hike begins at about 15 feet and climbs to about 400 feet with 
a considerable amount of elevation fluctuation along the way -- consider 
the distance when planning this hike, which is <b>12.1 miles out and back</b>. 
It's not hard, but it is long, so I rate it as moderate. <br>
<br>
<i>Exposure</i>:<br>
Mostly shaded.<br>
<br>
<i>Trail traffic</i>:<br>
Moderate. <br>
<br>
<i>Trail surfaces</i>:<br>
Dirt trails and fire roads.<br>
<br>
<i>Hiking time</i>:<br>
6 hours (this a long hike, so your time may vary considerably).<br>
<br>
<i>Season</i>:<br>
Nice any time.<br>

backcountry camps.<br>

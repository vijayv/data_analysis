From Interstate 280 in Santa Clara County, take CA 85 south (exit 12b, toward 
Gilroy).&nbsp;After about 12 miles, exit at Almaden Expressway (exit 6), 
make the first left, then the next right onto Almaden Expressway.&nbsp;Drive 
about 5 miles to the end of Almaden Expressway, and turn right onto Harry. 
Almost immediately, turn left onto McKean. McKean turns into Uvas Road after 
about 6.5 miles. Continue on Uvas for another 3.7 miles, then turn right 
onto Croy (there's a brown county park sign before the turnoff). Drive about 
3.8 miles to the park entrance at the end of the road. NOTE: the last 0.4 
mile or so of Croy passes through the Swedish private community of Sveadal. 
That stretch of road is very narrow, so drive slowly.<br>

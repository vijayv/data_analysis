2.6 mile out and back hike climbs along Cataract Falls in a wooded canyon.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>2.6 mile</b> <b>out and back hike</b> is short but moderate. Trailhead 
elevation is about 680 feet. The trail climbs to about 1100 feet in 0.5 
mile, then continues to a high point of about 1400 feet in another 0.8 mile. 
Some sections, mostly sets of steps, are very steep, and both trails and 
stairs can be slippery when wet. A trekking pole is a good accessory any 
time of the year, particularly if you've got troublesome hips or knees.<br>

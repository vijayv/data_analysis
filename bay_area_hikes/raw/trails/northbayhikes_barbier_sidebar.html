From US 101 in Marin County, exit Central San Rafael. Drive east on 2nd 
Street, past the busy supermarket district (2nd merges into 3rd, but you'll 
hardly notice), and continue on San Pedro Road as 3rd Street ends and San 
Pedro Road picks up (again, you won't notice this). After you've traveled 
about 3 miles from 101, look for a sign for Knight Road. Turn left onto 
Knight Road, drive about 0.4 mile, then turn left onto Rollingwood. Drive 
about 0.3 mile, then turn left onto Beechwood Court. The trail begins at 
the end of Beechwood, less than 0.1 mile from Rollingwood. <br>

Lots of street parking in a residential neighborhood. Please respect neighbors 
and keep your noise to a minimal level. No entrance or parking fees, maps, 
restrooms, pay phone, drinking water, or designated handicapped parking

31 and 32 stop at San Pedro and Knight, less than 1 mile from the trailhead.<br>
<br>
<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Pay phones, restaurants, gas, and stores back in central San Rafael. No 
camping in Barbier Park, but China Camp has a nice walk-in campground.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
No rules are posted at the trailhead or on the trails, but most China Camp 
trails are multi-use (you are not likely to see horses on this hike). A 
few (not in this part of the park) trails are designated hiking-only. Dogs 
are not permitted on every trail described below; they are permitted in 
the city park but not in the state park. For day use, the China Camp is 
open from 8 a.m. to sunset. Barbier Park is open from sunrise to sunset.<br>

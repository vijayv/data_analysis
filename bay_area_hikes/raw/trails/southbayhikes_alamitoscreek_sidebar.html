onto Coleman, right on Winfield, then turn right into the park. $6 parking 
fees are charged during summer months, but access is free other times of 
the year. You'll find restrooms, drinking water, and a pay phone at the

but interpretive signs along the trail highlight the route. There are several 
designated handicapped parking spaces, and trails are well suited to wheelchairs 
and strollers. This trail is accessible by public transportation. Visit 
the <a href="http://www.511.org" target="_blank">Transit Info website</a> 
for details. You can also access this trail via a 25 car <a href="/pictures/southbay/alamitoscreek/websize/33thead.jpg">trailhead 
(no fee) on Camden Avenue at Mt. Forest Drive</a>.<br>

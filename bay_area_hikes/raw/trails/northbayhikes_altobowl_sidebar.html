2.2 mile out and back hike through preserves bordering Mill Valley residential 
neighborhoods.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>2.2 mile out and back hike</b> is easy, with about 250 feet in elevation 
change. Trailhead elevation is about 330 feet. The hike dips to about 170 
feet, then climbs back to about 350 feet. On the return, you'll face the 
same, in reverse. There is one steep stretch. You can use this trailhead 
as a staging area for long and more challenging Mount Tam hikes (via Camino 
Alto Open Space Preserve), but there are other trailheads with more parking 
and easier access to the heart of Tam.<br>

From US 101 in Marin County, exit East Blithedale/Tiburon Boulevard. Drive 
west on East Blithedale about 0.8 mile, then turn right onto Camino Alto. 
Drive north on Camino Alto about 1.2 miles, to a pullout on the right side, 
about 120 feet from an open space gate on the right.<br>

<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Gas, pay phones, stores, and restaurants back around Camino Alto and Blithedale 
in Mill Valley. No camping in the immediate area.<br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Parking for about 4 vehicles in a narrow roadside pullout (parking is only 
available on the west side of the road, so it makes sense to approach the 
trailhead from Mill Valley rather than Corte Madera). This trailhead can 
be tricky to find. There are several likely-looking pullouts, but the one 
you're after is the first pullout past a wooden guardrail dotted with a 
multitude of reflectors, also on the right. If you miss the pullout (if 
you reach the crest of Camino Alto and the Mill Valley/Corte Madera border, 
you've gone too far), there is no parking available past the trailhead. 
You'll have to carefully turn around (I've done this at Chapman, which is 
the street just at the crest, and it's doable, but tricky), drive back downhill 
to Overhill, turn right, and then head back uphill on Camino Alto and try 
again. There are no parking or entrance fees. No drinking water, maps, or 
restrooms. No designated handicapped parking, and trails are not wheelchair 
accessible. There is no direct public transportation to this trailhead. 
You could pedal from bus stops on either Blithedale in Mill Valley or Tamalpais 
Drive in Corte Madera, but it's not a safe walk from either direction on 
Camino Alto to the trailhead.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Dogs are permitted on leash on trails; they are permitted off leash under 
voice command on fire roads, and dog owners must have a leash for each dog. 
Two Alto Bowl trails are multi-use, but no bikes are allowed on Bob Middagh 
and Horse Hill Trails.<br>

neighborhood to the top of the mountain. Hosts a Bay Area Ridge Trail segment.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty:<br>
</i>This <b>5.6 mile</b> <b>out and back hike</b> is moderately tough, but 
manageable, particularly if you visit on a cool day and bring plenty of 
water. Trailhead elevation is about 400 feet. The park's high point is about 
2517 feet; total elevation change for this hike is about 2200 feet. A Bay 
Area Hiker reader who preferred to remain anonymous describes the route 
perfectly: &quot;this trail is not for beginners or casual 'neighborhood' 
walkers. It is somewhat steep and continually demanding.&quot;<br>

&#149; From Interstate 880 in Alameda County, exit Warren/Mission Boulevard 
(exit 12). Drive northeast on Mission Boulevard, pass under 680, and turn 
right on Stanford Avenue. Drive about 0.5 mile to the trailhead at the end 
of the street. (Note: if you quake in fear at the thought of driving on 
880, and are traveling from the peninsula, you can take a slower, prettier, 
less stressful drive. Drive east across the bay on the Dumbarton Bridge, 
which becomes Decoto. About 4 miles from the Dumbarton Bridge toll plaza, 
turn right onto Paseo Padre Parkway. Drive south a few miles, to the junction 
with Mission Boulevard. Turn left, and make the first right onto Stanford 
Avenue.)<br>

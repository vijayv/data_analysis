<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Most trails are multi-use. Some restrict bikes. From the Coe Parks website: 
&quot;Dogs are not allowed on any of the hiking roads or trails, but the 
headquarters area has about a half mile of paved roads where dogs are 
allowed and it has a lovely, shady half-mile trail between the Visitor 
Center and the entrance parking lot where you can take your dog for a 
walk. Dogs must be kept on a leash at all times, and the leash must be 
no longer than 6 feet.&quot; <br>

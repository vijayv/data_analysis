7.2 mile out and back at the Hunting Hollow section of the park. Very 
good wildflower displays in spring.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>7.2 mile out and back hike</b> is one of the park's easiest, with 
only about 300 feet in elevation change. Coe is a huge park with some 
very tough hikes. Beware of some exceptionally steep trails that depart 
from this trailhead: you really need a good map if you plan on setting 
off into unknown territory.<br>

From US 101 in Santa Clara County, exit Leavesley. Drive east about 1.8

the brown parks signs for Coyote Lake County Park). Drive about 0.5 mile 
and turn right on Roop Road, then continue about 6.5 miles (past Coyote 
Lake) to the signed Hunting Hollow Trailhead on the right side of the 
road.<br>

<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Large dirt parking lot. Two pit toilets. No drinking water. $6 entrance 
fee per vehicle (there's a $8 day use fee at the park's <a href="headquarters.html">main entrance</a>). 
There are two good maps under glass at the information signboard, but 
on my visit there were no paper maps available. No designated handicapped 
parking, and trails are not wheelchair accessible. There is no direct 
public transportation to this trailhead. <br>
<br>
<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Gas, pay phone, stores, and restaurants back on Leavesley in Gilroy. The 
park has extensive backcountry camping options, and a small, developed 
campground at the park headquarters area.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Most trails are multi-use. Some restrict bikes. From the Coe Parks website: 
&quot;Dogs are not allowed on any of the hiking roads or trails, but the 
headquarters area has about a half mile of paved roads where dogs are 
allowed and it has a lovely, shady half-mile trail between the Visitor 
Center and the entrance parking lot where you can take your dog for a 
walk. Dogs must be kept on a leash at all times, and the leash must be 
no longer than 6 feet.&quot;<br>

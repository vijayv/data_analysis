brief</font></i><font size="-1">:<br>
Mount St. Helena is the Bay Area's highest publicly accessible (by trail) 
peak, topping out at 4,304 feet. This trek begins uphill on a short, eroded 
trail, then continues to the summit on a long, sinuous, well-graded fire 
road. There's very little challenge here, just a steady climb to the top, 
where views unfold, spanning the distance from the San Francisco skyline 
to Mount Lassen (on a clear day).<br>

Leave San Francisco via the Bay Bridge. Drive north on I-80 26 miles, then 
exit #33 onto CA 37. Drive west on CA 37 2.5 miles to the junction with 
CA 29. Turn right and drive north on CA 29 38 miles to the junction with 
CA 128. Turn right, and continue another 9 miles east on CA 29 into Robert 
Louis Stevenson State Park, where there's roadside parking on the left side 
of the road (there's a larger dirt lot on the right). <br>

<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
No camping in the park (nearest campground is at <a href="bothenapa.htm">Bothe-Napa Valley State 
Park</a>). All services are available in Calistoga. I highly recommend combining 
a Mount St. Helena hike with an overnight stay in one of Calistoga's mineral 
springs resorts. There are a variety of lodging choices, from basic motels 
to luxurious inns-just be sure to pick a place with a heated mineral pool 
to soak your tired legs after climbing the mountain.<br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
No fee. No facilities. Side of road parking in small dirt lots.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Dogs are not allowed on the park trails.<br>

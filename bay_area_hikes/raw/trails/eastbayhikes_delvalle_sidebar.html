From Interstate 580 in Alameda County, exit Central Livermore/North Livermore 
Avenue (exit 52b). Drive south on North Livermore, which turns into South 
Livermore, passes through downtown, makes a sharp left curve, and turns 
into Tesla Road (about 3.5 miles from 580). Just past the curve, look for 
the brown &quot;parks&quot; sign and turn right onto Mines Road. Drive about 
3.5 miles, at which point Mines Road veers left. Follow the brown parks 
signs, and stay straight on Del Valle Road about another 3.5 miles to the 
park entrance kiosk, on the right side of the road. Park near the snack 
bar if possible.<br>

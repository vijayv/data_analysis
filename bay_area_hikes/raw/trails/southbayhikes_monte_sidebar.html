Huge dirt parking lot. No entrance or parking fees.&nbsp;Maps are available 
at an information signboard. There are two designated handicapped parking 
spots; a short trail segment from the trailhead to a Monte Bello overlook 
was designed to be wheelchair accessible, but is often rutted. A particularly 
lovely pit toilet sits on the south side of the parking lot. There's no 
drinking water or direct public transportation to this preserve. <br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>

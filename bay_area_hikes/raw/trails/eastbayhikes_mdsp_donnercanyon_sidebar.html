5 mile partial loop up Donner Canyon, then past a series of waterfalls. 
There are a few steep sections of fire road, and many short steep stretches 
on the trail.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>5.0 mile</b> <b>partial loop hike</b> is moderate, with about 1300 
feet in elevation change. Although the featured hike is not long, I found 
it more difficult then expected. Trailhead elevation is about 540 feet, 
and the hike's high point is about 1700 feet. The hike has a few steep sections 
that are really tough when conditions are muddy, and trails wander up and 
down considerably.<br>

From CA 24 or Interstate 680 in Contra Costa County, exit Ygnacio Valley 
Road (exit 46b, at the 680 split). Drive east on Ygnacio Valley Road about 
7 miles, then turn south (right) on Clayton Road. Drive south on Clayton 
Road (which becomes Marsh Creek Road in Clayton) about 3 miles, and turn 
right on Regency Road (this road is easy to miss -- begin looking for it 
after you pass the junction with Marsh Creek Road). Drive to the trailhead 
at the end of the road. <br>

<br>
<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Gas, stores, restaurants, and pay phones about 3 miles north near Ygnacio 
Valley Road. The state park has several drive-in campgrounds, but these 
are reached from roads near the top of the mountain, not from this trailhead.<br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Side of the road parking at the edge of a residential neighborhood. No entrance 
or parking fees at this trailhead. No maps. No toilet facilities. No water. 
No designated handicapped parking, and trails are not wheelchair accessible. 
There is no direct public transportation to the park. <br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Most trails are multi-use. A few are open to hikers and equestrians, and 
some and hiking-only. No dogs. Technically, the park is open from 8 a.m. 
to 45 minutes before sunset, but this trailhead, with street parking, permits 
you to get an early start and stay a bit later.<br>

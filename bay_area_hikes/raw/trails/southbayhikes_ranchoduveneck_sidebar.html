6 mile out and back through the Duveneck Windmill area.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>6 mile out and back hike</b> is easy, with about 1000 feet in elevation 
change. Trailhead elevation is just over 400 feet, and from there you have 
no choice but to climb to at least 1100 feet. If you're ambitious you can 
ascend all the way to Black Mountain, elevation 2800 feet. Easier hikes 
descend to about 400 feet at the preserve's eastern section, but you'll 
have to climb back to Rhus Ridge Trail before you can drop down to the trailhead.<br>

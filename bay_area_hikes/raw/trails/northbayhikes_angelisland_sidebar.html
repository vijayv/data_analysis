<i><font size="-1">In 
brief</font></i><font size="-1">:<br>
Angel Island is a perfect day trip, where the journey to the trailhead rivals 
the hike for sheer relaxation and beauty. Since you can only reach Angel 
Island by boat, sit back and enjoy the ferry ride, then climb to the top 
of the island and back, with incredible 360-degree views nearly the entire 
trip. Just keep an eye on the clock to make sure you catch that last ferry.<br>

Unless you have a boat, Angel Island is only accessible by public transportation. 
Contact Blue and Gold 
Fleet, (415) 773-1188, for a ferry schedule.If you start a journey to Angel 
Island from a location served by BART or Muni trains, it makes perfect sense 
to take public transportation to the ferry landing at San Francisco's Pier 
41. Take BART or Muni to the Embarcadero station, come above ground and 
transfer to the F line (on the Embarcadero across from the Ferry Building), 
and proceed west to the Fisherman's Wharf stop. Ferries to Angel Island 
also depart from Tiburon and Alameda. If you want to drive to the ferry, 
the easiest and most direct route to Fisherman's Wharf from the Bay Bridge 
is via the Embarcadero. From the Golden Gate Bridge, take Lombard to Van 
Ness to North Point, then park in one of the parking garages at Fisherman's 
Wharf.<br>

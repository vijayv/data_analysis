4.7 mile out and back in a preserve wildly popular with mountain bikers.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>4.7 mile</b> <b>out and back hike</b> is easy, with about 400 feet 
in elevation change, but other options increase the hiking difficulty considerably. 
Trailhead elevation is around 1625 feet. The main trail, a wide fire road, 
heads downhill from there, with elevation near the western border of about 
500 feet. If you elect to hike the Sulphur Springs/Corral Trail Loop, you'll 
climb to over 2000 feet. This is a destination with long trails and plenty 
of elevation changes. <br>

<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
$10 entrance fee. $2 for a park map. Lots of parking in a paved lot. Some 
free parking on the side of CA 9 near the park entrance -- but it's

at the edge of the parking lot. There are designated handicapped parking 
spots, and Redwood Grove Loop Trail is wheelchair accessible. Metro bus 
#31 stops at the campground entrance, and #35 services Felton, but no bus

<i>Rules</i>:<br>
The park has a complicated set of rules, but following them is easy, since 
they're posted on the map and on trail signs throughout the park. Some trails 
(fire roads) are multi-use, others are open to hikers and equestrians, and 
a few are hiking only. Dogs are not permitted on every trail described in 
the following hike. They are permitted on leash only, on three trails: Pipeline 
Road, Meadow Trail, and Graham Hill Trail. For day use, the park is open 
during daylight hours only (generally dawn to dusk).<br>

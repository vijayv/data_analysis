<i>Difficulty</i>:<br>
Elevation ranges from sea level to about 180 feet. In general, the hiking is easy 
here, with a few exceptions. Sand Ladder Trail is very steep, but short. Trails 
can be impossible to follow, and it's easy to get off course. Some sections require 
scrambling down/up steep and sandy dunes. Walking is loose sand is not easy for 
most of us, and there's a lot of loose sand at Fort Funston.<br>
<br>
<i>Getting there</i>:<br>
&#149; From southbound CA 35 in San Francisco, pass John Muir Drive, then take 
the first right (signed Fort Funston). Bear right and continue to the parking 
lot.<br>

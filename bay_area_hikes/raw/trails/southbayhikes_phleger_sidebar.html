<br>
<i>Getting there</i>:<br>
&#149;&nbsp;From Interstate 280 in San Mateo County, exit CA 84 (Woodside 
Road). Drive west about 1.5 miles, then turn right onto Kings Mountain Road. 
Drive about 2 miles on this narrow and winding road (watch out for deer, 
cyclists, and motorcyclists), then turn right into Huddart County Park. 
Once past the entrance kiosk, park in the lot on the left.<br>
&#149;&nbsp;You may also enter the park from Skyline Boulevard. Park at 
MROSD's Purisima Creek Redwoods Open Space Preserve (the PC03 gate, not 
the main Purisima parking lot), cross Skyline Boulevard to enter Huddart, 
and then walk north into Phleger.<br>
&#149;&nbsp;A third access is via Crystal Springs Trail east of Phleger. 
This saves you the $6 entrance fee, but the walk to Crystal Springs Trail 
is not as pleasant as the wooded trails of Huddart. (If you're not familiar 
with the area, refer to a map.) Turn west off Ca&ntilde;ada Road onto Runnymede, 
then park at the curve in the road, where Runnymede changes to Raymundo. 
Walk on the side of the road about .75 mile to the end of Raymundo, and 
take Crystal Springs Trail into Huddart (you come out on Richard's Road 
Trail), then turn right and hike a little over 0.5 mile to the Phleger entrance 
on the right side of the trail. <br>

From Interstate 680 in Contra Costa County, exit Diablo Road (exit 39). 
Follow the green parks signs: drive east on Diablo Road (turn right at the 
junction with El Cerro), then turn left at the (stop sign) junction with 
Blackhawk onto South Gate Road. Drive carefully uphill on this narrow road 
(watch out for bicyclists) about 7 miles to a stop sign, then turn right 
onto Summit Road. Continue to the summit, about 4 more miles. Just before 
the road splits into two one-way segments, park in a small dirt area on 
the right (or park in the large lot back downhill a few yards). <br>

<br>
<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Gas, stores, and restaurants back near I-680 in Danville. The park has group 
campgrounds and individual campsites. Visit <a href="http://www.mdia.org/spcamp.htm" target="_blank">MDIA's 
website</a> for more info. <br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>: <br>
A few designated handicapped parking spots across from the start of the 
trail, and the first 0.18 mile of the trail is suitable for wheelchairs. 
Lots more parking just downhill in a big paved lot. $10 entrance fee. Restrooms, 
pay phone, and maps a little further uphill at the Summit Visitor Center 
(a  brochure is usually available at the start of 
the trail). Gas, restaurants, and stores in the town of Danville, near the 
680 exit on Diablo Road. There is no direct public transportation to the 
park. Note: carsick alert! If you or anyone in your vehicle is prone to 
carsickness, drive very slowly (no more than 20 mph) on the park roads. 
As there is no optional route to the top, slow smooth cornering may help 
avoid carsickness.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
No bikes or dogs. Horses are technically permitted, but you will probably 
not encounter any on this trail. The park is open from 8 a.m. to 45 minutes 
before sunset.<br>

From US 101 in Marin County exit Sir Francis Drake/San Anselmo. Drive west 
on Sir Francis Drake about 9.5 miles, then turn left onto Railroad Avenue 
(near Woodacre). Drive about 0.5 mile, then turn right onto Carson Road. 
Drive uphill on narrow and winding Carson Road for about 1 mile, where the 
road ends at Conifer Way. Make a very sharp left turn onto Conifer Way and 
drive slowly up this dirt road about 0.2 mile, to the open space gate at 
the end of the road. <br>

<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Parking for 3 vehicles in a rough dirt area near the gate. If those spaces 
are full, drive back down to Carson Road and park on the side of the road 
anywhere legal. Local restrictions demand that cars park at least 6 feet 
from the center of the road, so look for a pullout all the way off the pavement. 
This is absolutely a bare bones trailhead. No maps, no toilets, and no parking 
or entrance fees. No designated handicapped parking, and there is no wheelchair 
access. There is no direct public transportation to the trailhead, but Golden 
Gate Transit's #23 bus runs along San Geronimo Valley Drive, and you can 
walk into the preserve on Bates Canyon Trail, which departs from San Geronimo 
Valley Drive. <br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
All trails are multi-use. Dogs are permitted on leash on trails; off leash 
under voice command on fire roads. Dog owners must have a leash for each 
dog. <br>

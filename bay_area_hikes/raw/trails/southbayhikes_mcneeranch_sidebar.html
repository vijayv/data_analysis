&#149; From CA 1 in San Mateo County, drive about 4 miles south of the last 
Pacifica traffic signal (Linda Mar). Turn left into the small parking lot 
(or park a little further south in the lot on the right side of the road). 
The trailhead is not well signed, and is easier to find coming north. <br>
&#149; A couple of Pacifica locals recommend starting hikes into McNee Ranch 
from Higgins Way, a dead-end street on the north slope of the mountain. 
Get there from CA 1 by turning east onto Linda Mar, right onto Adobe, and 
finally, left onto Higgins Way. From here a fire road ascends 3.2 miles 
into McNee Ranch, joining North Peak Access Road about 2 miles from the 
summit. I haven't yet tried this, but hope to soon.<br>

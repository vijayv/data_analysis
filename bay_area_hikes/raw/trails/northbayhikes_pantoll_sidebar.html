4.3 mile loop to West Point Inn and back, with fantastic views south.<br>

<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>4.3 mile loop hike</b> is easy, with about 600 feet in elevation 
change. Trailhead elevation is around 1500 feet. This hike climbs to about 
2000 feet, and spends plenty of time on a mostly level course. It's an easy

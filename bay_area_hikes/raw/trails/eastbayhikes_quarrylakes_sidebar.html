Decoto a little more than 1 mile, then turn south (right) onto Paseo Padre 
Parkway. Drive about 0.7 mile, then turn left onto Isherwood Way. Almost 
immediately, just past the bridge over Alameda Creek, turn right into 
the signed Isherwood Staging Area parking lot. (Note: if you want to park 
inside Quarry Lakes, continue past the Isherwood Staging Area, about 0.6 
mile to the main park entrance on the right. There is a fee to park inside 
the recreation area.)<br>

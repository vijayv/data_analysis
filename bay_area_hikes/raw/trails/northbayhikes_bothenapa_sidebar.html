Services south in St. Helena or north in Calistoga. The park has a nice 
campground, with sites on either side of the campground road, and a small 
loop at the end. Some sites are shaded by the native forest and near a creek; 
most of the loop sites are sunnier, with manzanita providing some cover. 
Although sites are well spaced, there's not a lot of vegetation to provide 
privacy, and the road is close-by. There are also a handful of walk-in sites.<br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Pay $8 fee at entrance kiosk (self register if unattended). Parking for 
about 10 cars at the trailhead, more elsewhere in the park. Toilets about 
0.2 mile further down the road past the trailhead. Maps available (for $1) 
at the entry kiosk. Napa County's VINE bus service stops at the park entrance 
on CA 29: visit <a href="http://www.511.org">511.org</a>  for details. <br>

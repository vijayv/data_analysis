<i><font size="-1">In 
brief</font></i><font size="-1">:<br>
4.7 mile loop is just one more great trek in a cluster of open space preserve 
in this area. Look for wild turkeys and hope you don't meet up with any 
wild pigs.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>4.7 mile</b> <b>partial loop hike</b> is easy, with about 500 feet 
in elevation change. Trailhead elevation is about 2300 feet. On the featured 
hike you'll descend to about 2150 feet, then climb to 2500 feet. From the 
ridge, you can loop back to the trailhead, for an easy hike, or extend your 
walk for a more moderate to strenuous hike. The preserve's low point is 
at about 1900 feet, and hikes down into adjacent Portola Redwoods State 
Park require a long walk back to the trailhead, and are tough.<br>

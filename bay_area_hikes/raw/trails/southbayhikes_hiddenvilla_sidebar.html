3.7 mile loop at a private nonprofit preserve and farm.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>3.7 mile loop hike</b> edges toward the moderate side of easy, with 
about 900 feet in elevation change. Trailhead elevation is about 500 feet, 
and the preserve's high point is about 1240 feet. Hidden Villa abuts Rancho 
San Antonio Open Space Preserve, where the elevation soars to over 2600 
feet, and you can easily create long grueling hikes through the two preserves. 
If you stay inside the boundaries of Hidden Villa, choose from short 
and very easy nearly flat hikes, or more challenging, though still short 
treks with moderate elevation changes. <br>

<i><font size="-1">In 
brief</font></i><font size="-1">:<br>
7.5 mile loop climbs up and down grassy hillsides dotted with oaks, on the 
high slopes of Mount Hamilton. Great in early spring, but incredibly hot 
in summer.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>7.5 mile</b> <b>loop hike</b> is moderate, with about 1300 feet 
in elevation change. The park has high hills and a sloping valley in the 
middle, with elevation ranging from about 1300 to 2995 feet. Most trails 
are moderate, but should you visit in summer, be careful not to overexert 
and dehydrate yourself on the lightly (or not at all) shaded trails.<br>
<br>
<i>Exposure</i>: <br>
Some shade, but mostly exposed -- not a good choice in summer heat.<br>

From US 101 in Santa Clara County, exit Santa Clara Street/Alum Rock Avenue. 
Drive east on Alum Rock Avenue about 4 miles, then turn right onto Mount 
Hamilton Road. Drive about 8 miles on this narrow winding road (watch out 
for bicyclists, motorcyclists, deer, and foolhardy squirrels) to the park 
entrance on the right side of the road. Once past the entry kiosk, drive 
on the park road to the parking lot nearest the gated entrance to Hotel 
Trail (go straight past the first parking area on the left, then turn left 
where the road splits -- there are some nice shady spots near the restrooms).<br>

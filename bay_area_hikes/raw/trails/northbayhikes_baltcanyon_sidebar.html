From US 101 in Marin County, exit Paradise/Tamalpais Drive. Drive west on 
Tamalpais about 0.8 mile, then turn right at the stop sign onto Corte Madera. 
Drive about 0.6 mile (Corte Madera becomes Magnolia), then turn left onto 
Madrone Avenue (across from the Lark Creek Inn). Drive on narrow Madrone  about 0.8 mile, to a small turnaround at the end of the 
road. If you're nervous about narrow roads or worried about getting lost, you may want to check out Google streetview before you head out -- but note that you won't have a cell signal on the road near the trailhead. <br>

 <font size="-1"><i>In 
brief: </i><br>
This creek-to-peak 7.8 mile Diablo loop begins at Mitchell Canyon and climbs 
on fire roads, easily then steeply to Murchio Gap. Here the fun really begins 
on a rollicking single-track excursion over knife-edged Eagle Peak. From 
the exposed peak top, enjoy views of the park, then continue downhill at 
an often steep grade, back to the trailhead.</font><font size="-1"><br>

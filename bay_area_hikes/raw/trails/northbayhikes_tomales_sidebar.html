From US 101 in Marin County, exit Sir Francis Drake/San Anselmo. Drive west 
on Sir Francis Drake about 20 miles, to the junction with CA 1, turn 
right, drive 0.1 mile, and then turn left onto Bear Valley Road. After about 
2 miles, Bear Valley Road ends at Sir Francis Drake; turn left. Continue 
on Sir Francis Drake about 5.5 miles, and turn right onto Pierce Point Road. 
Drive about 1.2 miles to the park entrance on the right side of the road. 
Drive down the park road about 0.7 mile, to the ranger station, stop and 
pay the fee, then continue about 0.9 mile to the parking lot 
at the end of the road <i>(not</i> the Heart's Desire lot).<br>

<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Stores and restaurants on Sir Francis Drake in Inverness, and in Point Reyes 
Station. Gas in Point Reyes Station. For picnic fixings, I recommend the 
baked goods at Bovine Bakery and the cheese at Cowgirl Creamery, both in 
Point Reyes Station. There are overnight accommodations available on the 
eastern fringes of Point Reyes, including a handful of motels in Inverness, 
and numerous bed and breakfasts just off Sir Francis Drake. Point Reyes 
Hostel is an inexpensive lodging option. There is no car camping on the 
Point Reyes peninsula. Point Reyes has several hike-in campgrounds -- enquire 
at the Point Reyes Ranger Station in Bear Valley, or read more about the 
options <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.

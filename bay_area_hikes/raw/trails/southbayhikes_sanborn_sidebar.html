Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Gas, restaurants and stores in Saratoga. Sanborn-Skyline has a campground, 
accessible from CA 9 on the outskirts of Saratoga, with walk-in, RV, and 
a group campsite.<br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Small parking lot with room for about 6 vehicles. No parking or entrance 
fees (although entrance fees are collected at the park's main entrance). 
No toilets or drinking water. There's an emergency callbox on Skyline Boulevard, 
but the closest public pay phone is about 2 miles north, at Castle Rock 
State Park. No designated handicapped parking, and trails are not suitable 
for wheelchairs. There are two other significant Sanborn-Skyline Park trailheads 
along Skyline Boulevard: the first is about 1.5 miles south from CA 9. Look 
to the left for an unmarked dirt driveway leading to a rutted dirt parking 
lot. The second trailhead is easier to find; it's a broad dirt pullout about 
2.5 miles south of CA 9 across the road from the Castle Rock State Park 
entrance. Neither trailhead has facilities. The main park entrance is on 
Sanborn Road, about 1.75 miles from Saratoga via CA 9. There is no direct 
public transportation to the park.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Trails are open to hikers and equestrians only. No bicycles permitted. 
Park hours are 8 a.m. to sunset. Dogs are permitted in all areas except Skyline Trail North of Summit Rock Parking lot and the Connector Trail from Skyline Trail that leads into Castle Rock SP. Watch for signs<br>

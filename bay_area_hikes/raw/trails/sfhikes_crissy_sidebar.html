(Finding your way through the Presidio can be a challenge even for long 
time SF residents. Pay attention, or you'll end up on the other side of 
the Golden Gate Bridge.)<br>
&#149; From San Francisco, drive west on Marina Boulevard. At the intersection 
with Lyon Street, where Doyle Drive diverges left to the Golden Gate Bridge, 
continue straight onto Mason. Look for the East Beach entrance on the right.<br>
&#149; From Marin, drive south across the Golden Gate Bridge. Immediately past the toll plaza, turn right onto Merchant. Drive 0.2 mile, then turn left onto Lincoln. Drive about 1 mile, then turn left onto McDowell. Drive 0.2 mile, then turn right onto Mason. Continue about 1 mile, then turn left into the East Beach entrance.<br>

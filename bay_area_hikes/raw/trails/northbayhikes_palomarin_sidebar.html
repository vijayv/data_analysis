This 7.5 mile out and back along the coast of Point Reyes to Alamere Falls 
includes two tricky scrambles.<i><br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i></i>:<br>
This <b>7.5 mile</b> <b>out and back hike</b> is moderate, with about 600 
feet in elevation change. Trailhead elevation is about 250 feet, and the 
hike's highest point is only near 600 feet. Trails are for the most part, 
very gently graded. If you only go as far as Pelican Lake, I consider the 
hike easy, but if you continue to Alamere Falls, it's a bit tricky, with 
two scrambles, one easy and one rough.<i><i><br>

From US 101 in Marin County, exit CA 1/Mill Valley/Stinson Beach. Drive 
on Shoreline Highway to the junction with Almonte, about 1 mile. Turn left 
on CA 1 and drive about 2.5 miles to the junction with Panoramic. Continue 
straight on CA 1 about 13 miles to an unsigned junction with Olema-Bolinas 
Road (just past Bolinas Marsh).&nbsp;Turn left. Drive 0.1 mile to a T intersection 
with Olema-Bolinas Road, turn left, drive about 1 mile to the junction with 
Horseshoe Hill Road, and again, turn left. Drive to the next stop sign, 
then turn right onto Mesa Road. Drive about 4 miles, then continue the last 
1 mile on the dirt road to the trailhead at the end of the road.&nbsp;If 
you have a high-clearance vehicle, take it.&nbsp;The road isn't terrible, 
but can be washed out and bumpy.<br>

<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
There is plenty of parking and 2 wheelchair accessible pit toilets. No entrance 
or parking fees.&nbsp;No maps are available at the trailhead, but about 
0.1 mile north on the trail there is a signboard with a map. No drinking 
water at the trailhead or on the trail. The trail is not technically an 
all-access path, but is wheelchair-accessible; instead of heading up the 
steps, go south past the pit toilets and turn left on the gated vehicle 
entrance to the trail. You should be able to squeeze through the gap between 
the gate and vegetation, then navigate a short distance (depending on trail 
conditions) on Coast Trail. Beware of steep, unfenced dangerous cliffs. 
There is no direct public transportation to this trailhead.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Trails in this part of the park are open to hikers and equestrians only.

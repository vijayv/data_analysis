6.1 mile loop around and above Stevens Creek Reservoir.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>6.1 mile loop hike</b> is moderate. Trailhead elevation is 
around 400 feet. The featured hike's high point is about 1170 feet, but 
one trail wanders up and down considerably, and the hike's total ascent 
is about 1110 feet. You can take this hike in either direction, but Coyote 
Ridge Trail is a steep fire road, in my opinion, better hiked down than 
up.<br>
<br>
<i>Exposure</i>:<br>
Mix of sun and shade.<br>
<br>
<i>Trail traffic</i>:<br>

<br>
<i>Trail surfaces</i>:<br>

<i>Hiking time</i>:<br>

<br>
<i>Getting there</i>:<br>
From Interstate 280 in Santa Clara County, exit Foothill Expressway (exit 
#13) and drive south on Foothill Boulevard about 1 mile to the junction 
with Stevens Canyon Road. Stay in the middle right lane and drive on Stevens 
Canyon Road about 2 miles to the park entrance on the left side of the road. 
Drive downhill, pull into the Chestnut Picnic Area on the left to pay the 
entrance fee, then continue on the park road to the ranger station on the 
right side of the road.&nbsp;Pick up a map, then continue down the road 
to the Baytree Picnic Area at the end of the road.<br>

<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
$6 entrance/parking fee. Parking for 17 vehicles, and one designated handicapped 
parking spot. Restrooms and drinking water at picnic area. If you look at 
the map(s) on line before visiting these parks, note that although the maps 
show parking areas at the Madrone and Sycamore Group Areas, the gates leading 
to the areas are not always open. There is some roadside parking at this 
southern portion of the park, but your best bet is to use the main entrance 
to Stevens Creek County Park as a trailhead. There is no direct public transportation 
to the park. Trails are wheelchair accessible for short distances.<br>
<br>
<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Gas, pay phone, and store back on Stevens Canyon Road at Foothills. No camping.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Some trails are multi-use, some just open to hikers and equestrians, and 
a few hiking only. Dogs are not allowed on every trail on the hike described 
below: they are permitted below the dam on Stevens Creek Trail in Stevens 
Creek County Park, and on the Fremont Older trails.<br>

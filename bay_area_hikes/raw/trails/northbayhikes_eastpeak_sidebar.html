<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
The nearest gas station is about 12 miles back at Tam Junction. Restaurants 
and stores in Tam Junction or Stinson Beach, which is a few miles west of 
the Pantoll/Panoramic junction on CA 1. There is a walk-in campground 
at Pantoll.<br>
<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Large paved parking lot. $8 day use fee (self register). There are several 
designated handicapped parking spots, and Verna Dunshee Trail is wheelchair 
(and stroller) friendly. Facilities include wheelchair-accessible restrooms, 
pay phone, drinking water, snack bar (seasonal), and small visitor center 
(open weekends). There's a map under glass, but unless the visitor center 
is open, there are none to take with you. On the way to the trailhead, you 
can stop at Pantoll Ranger Station (at the junction of Panoramic and Pantoll) 
for a map. There is no direct public transportation to this trailhead; on 
weekends and major holidays cyclists can take Golden Gate Transit bus #63 
to the junction of Pantoll and Panoramic, then ride uphill to the trailhead: 
visit the <a href="http://www.511.org/" target="_blank">Transit 
Info website</a> for more details.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Park is generally open from 7 a.m. to sunset, when the gate at the Pantoll/Panoramic 
junction is locked. During high fire danger, access to the summit is restricted 
24 hours a day. Bikes are not permitted on the two main paths at the trailhead 
(Plankwalk and Verna Dunshee), but cyclists can ride many other trails that 
depart a short distance from the parking lot. Half of East Peak is owned 
by Marin Municipal Water District, and the other section is State Park land, 
so the rules regarding dogs are a bit confusing. Dogs are not permitted 
on Verna Dunshee Trail, but in the adjacent MMWD lands, dogs are allowed, 
on leash only. To be honest, if you're just visiting the summit to hike 
Plankwalk Trail, this isn't a great place for dogs, as the trail is narrow, 
usually crowded, and very rocky. <br>

<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Side of street parking at the edge of a residential neighborhood. No entrance 
or parking fees. No maps or restrooms on site. There's a water fountain 
across the street near the tennis courts. No services in the immediate area, 
but there's a mini mart back towards US 101 on Lucas Valley Road. There 
is no designated handicapped parking, and trails are not well suited to 
wheelchairs. During commute hours, you can take Golden Gate Transit bus 
#41 or 44 to Lucas Valley Road and Westgate. From there it's an easy walk 
to the preserve.<br>

Trails are multi-use. Dogs are permitted on leash on trails; off leash under 
voice command on fire roads. Dog owners must have a leash for each dog.

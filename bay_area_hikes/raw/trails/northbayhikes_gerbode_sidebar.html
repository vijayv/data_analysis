Getting there</i>:<br>
From US 101 in Marin County, take the Alexander/Sausalito Exit (going north, 
it's the first exit after you've crossed the Golden Gate Bridge, heading 
north, it's the last one before you cross it).&nbsp;Drive east and turn 
left onto Bunker Road.&nbsp;There is a one-way tunnel which cuts under 101, 
and you may need to wait up to 5 minutes for your turn to travel through 
it (this is a great opportunity to put on sunscreen). From the other side 
of the tunnel, drive about 1.5 miles, then turn right onto a parking lot.<br>

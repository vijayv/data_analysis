Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Side of the street parking on dead-end Breakwater. No parking or entrance 
fees. There are two other trailheads to the north on Grant and West Winton. 
Maps available at the Interpretive Center (open weekends only), and theoretically 
at the information signboard at the start of the trail, but the box was 
empty and looked pretty dusty on my visit. There's a wheelchair-accessible 
portable toilet just off the road, but there is no drinking water. No designated 
handicapped parking, but trails may be suitable for wheelchairs (weather 
permitting; they aren't paved). There is no direct public transportation 
to the shoreline, but several AC Transit buses stop at West Winton, and 
from there you can walk to the shoreline. <br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Trails are open to hikers and cyclists. No dogs. Shoreline is open from 
5 a.m. to 10 p.m.<br>

(Note: Google will direct you to a spot quite short of the trailhead. Continue to the obvious parking lot at the end of the Westshore Road.)
From Bodega Bay (Sonoma County), turn west onto Eastshore Road. Drive about 
0.3 mile on Eastshore to a stop sign, then turn right onto Bay Flat Road. 
Drive about 3.4 miles, initially along the harbor (where the road seamlessly 
turns into Westshore Road), then after a sharp hairpin turn, uphill to an 
unsigned fork. Bear right and continue 0.2 mile to the parking lot.<br>

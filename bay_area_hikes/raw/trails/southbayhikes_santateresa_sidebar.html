From Interstate 280 in Santa Clara County, exit #12B CA 85. Drive south 
on 85 and exit #1B Bernal Road/US 101. Drive west on Bernal Road, past Santa 
Teresa Boulevard, into the park. Continue uphill, and turn left, following 
the signs for the picnic area (if you start seeing ominous signs for IBM, 
you've gone too far). Park near the Pueblo Group Picnic Area, if possible.<br>

<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
Lots of parking. $6 entrance fee; use the automated payment box (bring sturdy 
bills, or a lot of change). Designated handicapped parking spots in some 
parking lots. Wheelchair-accessible restrooms across from Pueblo Group Picnic 
Area parking lot. Trails are technically accessible to wheelchairs, but 
I doubt that even with assistance they could be navigated. There are a couple 
of drinking fountains near the parking lots. Maps available at a signboard 
near the Pueblo Group Picnic Area. Emergency phone in the northernmost parking 
lot. There is no direct public transportation to this park, but you can 
walk from the VTA bus stop: visit the <a href="http://www.transit.511.org" target="_blank">Transit 
Info website</a> for details.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Most trails are multi-use. A few restrict bicycles. Dogs are permitted on 
the hike described below, and are allowed on all park trails (they are restricted 
from some park areas). Park is open from 8 a.m. to sunset. <br>

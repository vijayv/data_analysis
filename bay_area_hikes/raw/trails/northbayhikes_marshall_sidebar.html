(Note: Google's destination is a bit shy of the trailhead. Continue about 300 more feet to the obvious parking at the end of the road.)
From US 101 in Marin County, exit Sir Francis Drake/San Anselmo. Drive 
west on Sir Francis Drake about 20 miles, to the junction with CA 1, turn 
right, drive 0.1 mile, and then turn left onto Bear Valley Road. After 
about 2 miles, Bear Valley Road ends at Sir Francis Drake; turn left. 
Continue on Sir Francis Drake about 5.5 miles, and turn right onto Pierce 
Point Road. Drive about 1.3 miles (just past the Tomales State Park entrance) 
and turn right onto Duck Cove/Marshall Beach Road. The road starts out 
narrow and paved, but soon becomes a wide dirt/gravel road, with open 
range cattle roaming about and sometimes sitting on or along the road. 
Drive about 2.5 miles, following the brown &quot;parks&quot; signs to 
the trailhead: go straight at the first junction with a dirt farm road, 
then left at the Y. The trailhead is at the end of the road.<br>

<i>Gas, food, and lodging</i>:<br>
Pay phone, stores, and restaurants back in Inverness. Gas in Point Reyes 
Station. There are overnight accommodations available on the eastern fringes 
of the park, including a handful of motels in Inverness, and numerous 
bed and breakfasts just off Sir Francis Drake. Point Reyes has several 
hike-in campgrounds -- enquire at the Point Reyes Ranger Station in Bear 
Valley, or read more about the options <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. 
No car camping in the park. Point Reyes Hostel, on Limantour Road, is 
an inexpensive lodging option. <a href="pointreyesguide.html">Read my page  describing Point Reyes hikes, accommodations, food, and more</a>.</font></p>
<p> <font size="-1"><i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
No entrance or parking fees. No amenities whatsoever: no water, toilets, 
maps, pay phone, or designated handicapped parking (and trail access is 
obstructed). Just a rough dirt parking area (although there are pit toilets 
at the beach). The road should present no problems for low clearance vehicles 
during dry months of the year, but you might want to inquire at the ranger 
station about conditions after a storm or during winter. The Bear Valley 
Visitor Center (look for the sign on Bear Valley Road) has maps and drinking 
water. There is no direct public transportation to this trailhead. <br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Trails are multi-use. No dogs. <br>

From CA 24 in Alameda County, exit CA 13 south (exit 5). Drive south on 
CA 13 about 3 miles, then exit Lincoln/Joaquin Miller Road (exit 2). At 
the base of the exit ramp, turn left, cross over the highway, then bear 
right onto Joaquin Miller Road. Drive uphill about 0.8 mile, then turn left 
onto Sanborn Drive (look for the Woodminster sign). Drive about 0.1 mile 
on Sanborn Drive, and park in the lot (or along the side of the road) near 
the ranger station. <br>

<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
There is a medium-sized paved lot, but many people park along the side of 
Sanborn Drive. Mind the no parking signs. If there is no parking inside 
the park, you can easily and legally park on the side of Joaquin Miller 
Road and walk in. No entrance or parking fees. Restrooms, pay phone, maps, 
and drinking water at the ranger station. There is one designated handicapped 
parking spot in the parking lot (which also services the Joaquin Miller 
Community Center), but trails here are poorly suited to wheelchairs. AC 
Transit bus #53 stops in front of the park.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Some trails are open to hikers, cyclists, and equestrians. There are a few 
closed to bikes, and some trails are signed hiking only. Dogs are permitted 
on leash only (but are not allowed in picnic areas). Park is open from dawn 
to dusk.<br>

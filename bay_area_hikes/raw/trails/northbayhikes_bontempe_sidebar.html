5 mile loop through chaparral and deep woods, on the northern flank of Mount 
Tamalpais.<br>
<br>
<i>Distance, category, and difficulty</i>:<br>
This <b>5 mile</b> <b>loop hike</b> is moderate, with about 700 feet in 
elevation change. Trailhead elevation is around 690 feet. The featured hike's 
high point is around 1253 feet. The elevation change may seem minimal, but 
the featured hike is not easy. There are steep sections along Rocky Ridge 
and Kent Trails, and some short scrambles over fallen trees and rocks along 
Alpine Lake. Rocky Ridge is indeed well-named and the trail can leave your 
feet sore so wear sturdy boots. High temperatures exacerbate hiking difficulty 
here. There are easier and harder hikes originating from Bon Tempe. A map 
with topography (see maps below), is essential 
for hike planning.<br>

(Note: Google will direct you past the trailhead unto the actual trail! Do not proceed in your vehicle past the gated fire road -- park in the pullout.)
From US 101 in Marin County, exit San Anselmo/Sir Francis Drake. Drive west 
on Sir Francis Drake about 5 miles to the town of Fairfax. Turn left on 
Pastori, make the first right onto Broadway, and then turn left on Bolinas. 
Drive about 1.5 miles on (what is now signed as) Fairfax-Bolinas Road, then 
turn left onto Sky Oaks Road (signed to Lake Lagunitas). Once past the entrance 
kiosk, drive about 0.4 mile, and turn right (to Bon Tempe) at a signed junction 
onto a gravel road. Drive about 0.3 mile, then bear left (unsigned) to the 
trailhead (if you get to a second parking lot at the end of the road you've 
gone too far).<br>

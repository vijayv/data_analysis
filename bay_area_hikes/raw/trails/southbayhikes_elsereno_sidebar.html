From Interstate 280 in Santa Clara County, exit CA 17 south. Drive south 
to the Alma Bridge/Bear Creek Road exit. At the base of the exit ramp, follow 
the signs for Montevina Road: drive about 0.5 mile on the road parallel 
to 17, past Black Road, then follow Montevina uphill. Drive carefully on 
narrow and winding Montevina, about 3.5 miles to a small pullout at the end of 
the road.<br>

<br>
<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
A rough and rutted dirt pullout provides parking for 2 or 3 vehicles at 
the edge of a residential neighborhood. No entrance or parking fees. No 
toilet facilities, maps, or water in the preserve; be sure to bring plenty 
of water. There is no designated handicapped parking, and trail access for 
wheelchairs is obstructed by a step-over. Note: as there is very limited 
parking at this preserve, you may want to have an option in mind if the 
pullout is full. Four other nearby places to hike are <a href="stjosephs.htm">St. 
Joseph's Hill Open Space Preserve</a>, <a href="sanborn.html">Sanborn-Skyline 
County Park</a>, <a href="sierraazul/sierraazul.html">Sierra Azul Open Space 
Preserve</a>, and <a href="castlerock.html">Castle Rock State Park</a>. 
St. Joseph's and Sierra Azul are just across CA 17, and Sanborn-Skyline 
and Castle Rock are closer than you might think; just take Black Road to 
Skyline Boulevard and drive a few miles north. There is no direct public 
transportation to this trailhead.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
All trails but one are multi-use. One is hiking only. No dogs in this part of the preserve, but they are allowed on Overlook Trail (check the map for details). Preserve 
is open from dawn to one half hour after sunset.<br>

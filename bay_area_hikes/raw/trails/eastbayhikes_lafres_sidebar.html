<i>Trailhead details</i>:<br>
You can park in metered spaces for up to 2 hours, or pay $7 and park all 
day in the lot. Bring exact change for the automated entrance kiosk to the 
lot, which is only staffed weekends and holidays. (Should you arrive without 
appropriate funds, you can walk to the Visitor Center where staff will change 
larger bills.) If you plan on walking the Lakeside Trail, you should be 
able to make the circuit in less than 2 hours (so save yourself some money 
and park in the metered spaces), but if you're aiming for the Rim Trail 
loop, you might want to park in the lot. (To avoid the park fees all together, 
enter the park from the surrounding neighborhood. From downtown Lafayette, 
take Moraga Road south. Turn right on Campolindo Drive. At the end of Campolindo, 
make a right onto Paseo Grande. There's side of the road parking at Paseo 
Grande's cul de sac.) There are designated handicapped spots, and Lakeside 
Trail is paved and wheelchair accessible. Wheelchair-accessible vault toilets 
at the edge of the parking lot, more vault toilets around Lakeside Trail. 
Drinking fountains near the parking lot and at several other locations along 
the trails. Pay phone at west end of parking lot. There is no direct public 
transportation to the reservoir, and nearby BART and bus stops are probably 
too far from the reservoir for hikers. Cyclists should have no problem riding 
from the Lafayette BART station.<br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
Recreation area is open from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (later in summer and 
autumn). No horses. Dogs permitted on leash. Bicycles permitted on the paved 
Lakeside Trail (specific hours only on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, not

From Interstate 680 in Contra Costa County, exit Diablo Road (exit 39). 
Follow the green &quot;parks&quot; signs: drive east on Diablo Road (turn 
right to continue on Diablo Road at El Cerro), then turn left at the (stop 
sign) junction with Blackhawk onto Mount Diablo Scenic Boulevard. Drive 
north on Mount Diablo Scenic Boulevard, which morphs into South Gate Road 
at the park boundary. Drive carefully uphill on this narrow road (watch 
out for bicyclists) to the entrance kiosk. Then continue about 1.5 miles 
to the broad flat parking lot on the right side of the road (the Curry Point 
sign is near the start of the trail, but it's the first parking lot past 
Rock City). <br>

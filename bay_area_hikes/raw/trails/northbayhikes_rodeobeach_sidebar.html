&#149; From northbound US 101 in San Francisco County, cross the Golden 
Gate Bridge and exit at Alexander (the first exit past the view point turnoff).&nbsp;After 
about 0.3 mile, turn left onto Bunker Road.&nbsp;There is a one-way tunnel 
which cuts under 101, and you may need to wait up to 5 minutes for your 
turn to travel through it (this is a great opportunity to put on sunscreen). 
From the other side of the tunnel, drive about 3 miles on Bunker Drive to 
the trailhead at the end of the road.<br>
&#149; From southbound US 101 in Marin County, exit Sausalito (the last 
exit before the bridge). Drive uphill on Conzelman Road, then turn right 
onto McCullough Road. Descend on McCullough to a junction with Bunker Road, 
and turn left. Drive west on Bunker to the trailhead at the end of the road.<br>

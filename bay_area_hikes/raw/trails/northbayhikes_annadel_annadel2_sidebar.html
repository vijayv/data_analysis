From US 101 in Sonoma County, exit CA 12. Head east, making a few turns to stay 
on 12: turn left on Farmer's Lane and right on 4th Street. Then turn right on 
Mission Boulevard and immediately get into the left lane. Turn left onto Montgomery, 
and then turn right onto Channel Drive. Stay on Channel at the junction with 
the road to Spring Lake, and park in the first dirt lot on the left side of 
the road, across from the Cobblestone Trailhead. (By the way, everyone seems 
to have their own special way to get to this park. Feel free to consult a detailed 
map, and find your own way.)<br>
<br>
<i>Details</i>:<br>
Pay $6 entrance fee at ranger station (self register). Parking for about 20 
cars, more in other parts of the park. There's a map under glass at this trailhead, 
but none to take with you. If you don't have a map (if you don't know the park, 
you'll need one), drive a bit further down Channel Drive to the ranger station 
and pick one up there. No restrooms. Gas, restaurants, and stores on CA 12, 
a few miles to the west. Public transportation to the park is available; visit 
the <a href="http://www.transitinfo.org/" target="_blank">Transit Info</a> website 
for details. <br>
<br>
<i>Rules</i>:<br>
All but one trail are multi-use. Dogs are not allowed on the trails.<br>

Small dirt parking lot. Additional street parking in residential neighborhood. 
No entrance or parking fees. No restrooms. Water fountain at trailhead. 
Maps available at information signboard. Pay phone, gas, restaurants, and 
stores about 3 miles northwest on San Pablo Dam Road. Note: When I visited 
in January 2002, the parking lot was deeply rutted and showed evidence of 
storm damage. If you go during wet months, you may want to bring a 4-wheel 
drive vehicle, so you don't get stuck in the mud, or park in the street. 
This trailhead does not offer access to wheelchair users. There is no direct 
public transportation to the park. <br>

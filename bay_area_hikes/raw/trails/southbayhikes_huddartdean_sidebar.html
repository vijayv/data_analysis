<i>Getting there</i>:<br>
From Interstate 280 in San Mateo County, exit Woodside Road (CA 84). Drive 
west about 1.5 miles, and turn right onto Kings Mountain Road. Drive about 
2 miles to the park entrance on the right side of the road. Once past the 
entrance kiosk, follow the signs for the Miwok Group Area: at the stop sign 
go straight, then stay straight (left) at the turnoff for the Werder and 
Zwierlein Areas, then bear left (you can't go straight), pass the Madrone 
Area, and turn right onto the road around the Miwok Area. Park by the signed 
entrance to the Dean Trail (on the right side of the road). If you get to 
the signed trailhead to Archery Fire Road, you've gone too far, but you 
can park there and walk back down the road to the trailhead. <br>
